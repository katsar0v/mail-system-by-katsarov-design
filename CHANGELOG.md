# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Themed API Reference documentation page** — the developer API reference is now published as a styled GitHub Pages subpage (`docs/api-reference.html`) that matches the project landing page, with a sticky "On this page" table of contents, syntax-highlighted PHP samples, copy-to-clipboard buttons on every code block, and a responsive layout. The Documentation links now open the rendered page instead of the raw Markdown file.

### Changed

### Fixed
- **Bulgarian status labels no longer mix singular and plural** — the campaign queue showed a single campaign as "Завършена" (feminine singular) next to "Отменени" (plural), because one string served both the status badge of a single item and the filter links that count many. Status, type and subscriber labels that describe a single row now use context-qualified strings (`_x()`), so Bulgarian can render campaign badges as feminine singular ("Завършена", "Отменена", "Насрочена"), email badges as masculine singular ("Изпратен", "Неуспешен", "Отменен") and the filter links as plural ("Завършени", "Отменени", "Насрочени"). German keeps its existing wording, and the date columns "Sent"/"Opened"/"Scheduled" now read as column headers ("Изпратен на", "Gesendet am") instead of as filter labels.

### Security

## [1.1.3] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- **JWT-authenticated REST API for campaign scheduling (#118)**
  - New `mail-system/v1` REST namespace: `GET /lists`, `POST /campaigns`, `GET /campaigns/{id}`, and `POST /campaigns/{id}/cancel`
  - Bearer-token authentication using self-contained HS256 JSON Web Tokens signed with a secret derived from the site's WordPress salts — no production Composer dependency
  - Scopes (`campaigns:read`, `campaigns:write`) enforced per route; `Idempotency-Key` header prevents duplicate scheduling on client retries; optional ISO-8601 `scheduled_at` with rejection of malformed or past times
  - New **Mail System → API Access** admin page to create tokens (name, expiry of 30/90/365 days or never, scopes) and revoke them; generated tokens are shown once and only a hash of each token identifier is stored, so deleting a token immediately and irreversibly revokes it
  - New `docs/rest-api.md` (endpoint reference, cURL examples, error catalogue, `Authorization`-header troubleshooting) and `docs/architecture.md` (layering overview)
- **Reusable campaign application service** — `MSKD\Application\Campaign_Service` centralizes campaign validation, list resolution, recipient deduplication and scheduling so the admin compose wizard and the REST API enforce identical rules. `MSKD\Application\Campaign_Query_Service` provides campaign status and list read models.

### Changed
- Campaign creation is now **transactional**: the campaign row and its queue entries are committed together, and a campaign that ends up with zero deliverable recipients is rolled back instead of being reported as a successful, empty send. The admin compose controller reports the actual number of recipients queued.
- The compose controller now delegates recipient resolution, Bcc validation and scheduling to the shared `Campaign_Service` rather than duplicating that logic.

### Fixed
- **Full-width admin queue layout (#122)** — the queue table now clears the floated status filters and uses the available WordPress admin content width without forcing page-level horizontal scrolling.
- **Fresh-install schema drift** — a brand-new installation's campaigns table was missing the `bcc`, `bcc_sent`, `from_email`, and `from_name` columns that every campaign insert expects, and the queue `status` enum omitted the `cancelled` state that cancellation code writes. The canonical schema now includes them, and an upgrade path (schema version 1.9.0) repairs existing installs.

### Security
- **Duplicate delivery from overlapping cron runs** — the queue worker now atomically claims each pending item (a guarded `pending → processing` transition backed by a new `processing_started_at` column and a composite `(status, scheduled_at)` index) before sending, so two concurrent cron runs can no longer send the same email twice. Stuck-item recovery is keyed off when an item was actually claimed rather than its original schedule.
- REST-supplied email bodies are constrained to the plugin's email-safe HTML allowlist (`mskd_kses_email`), and the JWT decoder accepts only `HS256`, rejecting the `alg:none` bypass and asymmetric-to-symmetric algorithm-confusion attacks.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Local email delivery guard (#114)** — outgoing email, SMTP connection tests, and queue processing are blocked when WordPress reports a `local` environment or the site uses a common local-development hostname. Administrators see a persistent warning on Mail System pages, and detection remains filterable for project-specific setups.
- **Secure email click analytics (#113)**
  - Rewrites eligible campaign and one-time email links through HMAC-signed, recipient-specific redirect URLs
  - Records privacy-safe first/last click timestamps, repeat counts, inferred opens, unique clickers, CTR/CTOR, and per-link performance
  - Excludes unsubscribe/confirmation links, unsupported schemes, and `data-mskd-no-track` anchors
  - Prevents BCC attribution by disabling open and click tracking on any message copy carrying BCC
  - Adds schema version 1.8.0, uninstall/truncate cleanup, public redirect validation, and automated security/send-path coverage
- **Per-recipient email open analytics (#111)**
  - Adds an unpredictable tracking token and invisible 1×1 pixel to newly queued campaign and one-time emails
  - Records the first open timestamp and total pixel load count without storing IP addresses or user-agent data
  - Shows unique opens, open rates, and per-recipient sent/open timestamps in the Queue overview and campaign detail screens
  - Includes a database upgrade to schema version 1.7.0, unit coverage, and an in-product caveat explaining image blocking, privacy proxy, and prefetch limitations
- **Bulk Subscriber Status Actions**
  - New "Set active" and "Set inactive" options in the bulk actions dropdown on the Subscribers page
  - Available whenever there are editable database subscribers to select, even if no lists exist yet
  - `Subscriber_Service::batch_update_status()` validates the target status and updates selected subscribers, reporting success/failed counts and errors
  - New `mskd_batch_update_subscriber_status` AJAX action, nonce- and capability-checked
  - Status badges in the table update immediately after a successful bulk update
  - Full translations in Bulgarian and German, unit tests covering success, missing subscriber, invalid/empty IDs, and invalid status cases
- **Delete Unconfirmed and Inactive Subscribers**
  - New "Delete unconfirmed and inactive subscribers" button in Admin > Settings > Danger Zone
  - Deletes all subscribers with `inactive` (unconfirmed) status and their list associations
  - Uses `window.confirm` dialog before performing the irreversible action
  - AJAX-powered deletion with real-time feedback
  - Full translations in Bulgarian and German with pluralization support
- **GA4 Conversion Tracking**
  - New "Enable GA4 Tracking" setting in Admin > Settings > Subscription Form
  - Tracks subscription form submissions as conversion events in Google Analytics 4
  - Sends `subscribe` event with event parameters when users successfully subscribe
  - JavaScript-based tracking that integrates with existing GA4 setup
  - Unit tests added for styling settings including GA4 tracking configuration
- **Mass Delete Subscribers**
  - New "Delete" option in bulk actions dropdown on subscribers page
  - Ability to delete multiple subscribers at once with confirmation dialog
  - AJAX-powered deletion with real-time feedback
  - Proper database cleanup (subscribers, list associations, and queue items)
  - Full translations in Bulgarian and German with pluralization support

### Changed
- **Renamed plugin slug** from `mail-system-by-katsarov-design` to `mail-system`. Updated main plugin file, all language files (`.pot`, `.po`, `.mo`), text domain references across all PHP source files, `package.json`, `bin/create-release.sh`, and documentation headers. DB table names, option keys, hooks, and constants are unchanged.
- **Delete Inactive Subscribers button** now also deletes subscribers with `unsubscribed` status, in addition to `inactive` (unconfirmed). Updated button description, confirmation dialog, and success messages accordingly. Translations updated for Bulgarian and German.

### Fixed
- **Bulk actions Apply button not showing** — on the Subscribers page, if a browser restored the bulk actions dropdown's previous value on page load/refresh without firing a `change` event, the Apply button stayed hidden even though a bulk action was selected and subscribers were checked. The button's visibility is now synced on page load, not only on `change`.
- **Opt-in confirmation email wrappers** — confirmation emails now apply the configured email header and footer and replace wrapper template variables (`{first_name}`, `{last_name}`, `{email}`, `{unsubscribe_link}`, `{unsubscribe_url}`) before sending.
- **SMTP password encryption delimiter handling** — encrypted payloads now encode the IV separately before adding the delimiter and still support legacy raw-IV payloads, preventing rare decrypt failures when random IV bytes contained the delimiter sequence.
- **Database repair notice persisting infinitely** — when clicking "Repair Database Now", if the required database table or column did not exist (or `ALTER TABLE` silently failed), the repair notice was shown on every page load indefinitely. The handler now calls `MSKD_Activator::activate()` (which uses `dbDelta` to create missing tables and columns), verifies the schema afterwards, and — if still failing — shows an actionable error notice with the database error message. The schema check also now correctly detects a missing table (not just a missing column).
- **Scheduling/queue timezone mixing** — the scheduling and queue system wrote datetimes from three different bases (WP-local `current_time`, UTC `gmdate`, and the MySQL `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` default), then compared and rendered them as if identical. On sites whose WordPress timezone differs from UTC, this produced a phantom offset between the Queue "Created" and "Scheduled for" columns and broke retry/stuck-recovery timing (retries landed in the past and fired immediately). Retry `scheduled_at` and the stuck-recovery threshold now use the new site-local `mskd_local_time_from_timestamp()` helper, and campaign/queue `created_at` is set explicitly via `mskd_current_time_normalized()` instead of the DB-server-timezone default, so all writes, comparisons, and display share one convention.
- **Email preview opening in a new tab** — email preview forms (campaign/queue detail and compose wizard) targeted a runtime-generated browsing-context name and then renamed the iframe to match, which is racy and often failed to bind, causing the preview to open in a new tab instead of inline. Preview iframes now render a stable server-side `name`, and the hidden preview form submits to that existing target.
- Fixed undefined variable `$class` (should be `$class_name`) in test bootstrap autoloader, which caused PHP 8.1 test failures due to undefined variable warnings being converted to exceptions.
- **Compose Wizard Step 1 Validation** — fixed bug where "Please select at least one list" alert incorrectly appeared when clicking Continue in step 1. List validation now only triggers in step 3 where list selection is available.
